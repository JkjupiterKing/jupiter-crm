Delete Sale: Not implemented.

Sale Details: All detail view pages show 404 errors.

Services

Add/Schedule Service: Form loads but date input is buggy and prevents most successful submissions.

Edit Service: Edit form appears but fails save (again due to date input issues).

Delete Service: Not implemented and /delete URLs return 404.

Detail View: 404 on direct access for every service.

Filters: Dashboard shows overdue/due services, but filter views in the list always show “No services found” (data mismatch/sync problem).

Reports

All core analytics and export features work for Sales, Customer, Inventory, Service, Warranty, and Revenue Reports.

Data is displayed and analytics metrics show expected content (no critical issues noticed in reporting).

Settings

General Settings: Company details and application settings have broken input behavior (editing concatenates content).

Notifications: SMS/WhatsApp/APIs input fields work; notification prefs are functional.

Database, Users, Security, Backup & Restore: All these sections are under development with no options implemented and just show a placeholder.

Other General Issues

Delete functionality: Consistently missing in all modules tested.

Detail/View pages: All direct access via URL produces 404 for nearly every module (customers, products, sales, services, spare parts).

Several sections under settings are not available at all.
